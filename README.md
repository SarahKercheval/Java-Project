# Java-Project
Java project for CS 110, Intro to CS

The game will break if you hit cancel or exit out of the dialog boxes without it doing so naturally. 
It will also exit if you don't type in a number when it asks for a number.

In order to play the game, please read the dialog box texts thoroughly, as it is an exploratory game.
There will be numbers associated with each of the potentional choices, the program takes those numbers as the input. The ONLY exception to this is when the game asks you for your name.
Please do not try to put in words/letters when the dialog boxes ask for input.

At several points throughout the game there's an option to take items, if you choose to take the items, they will be added to a text file made in game, called Inventory.
Your character stats (class, hitpoints, name), will also be written to a text file at the beginning of the game.
These files will be reference multiple times throughout the game for the purposes of display certain options. Please do not delete them while playing. 
The text files will automatically rewrite over themselves everytime you restart the game.
This game is based on the Curse Of Strahd DnD campaign, specifically 'The Death House'. It is not exactly the same, but it shares similarities.
There are a number of ways to end the game without breaking it. Mainly by dying.
Have fun, good luck!
